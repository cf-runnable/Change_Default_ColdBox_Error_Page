The ColdBox MVC Platform automatically handles errors that your application code does not catch and displays a nice error page fill with useful debugging information for developers.  This defult error template is located in /coldbox/system/includes/BugReport.cfc and is not intended for public consumption.  The production version of your site should override this page using the CustomErrorTemplate setting so your site users can see a pretty page that doesn't devulge the secure inner workings of your application.  This sample shows a custom error template in action.
